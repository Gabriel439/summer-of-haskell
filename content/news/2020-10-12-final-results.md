[Haskell.org] took part in [Google Summer of Code] again in 2020.  Despite
unfortunately receiving less slots from Google this year, we had a number of
highly successful projects.  In this blogpost, I've collected all write-ups and
reports from the students for your convenience.

1.  **SPECIALIZABLE GHC pragma**  
    Student: Francesco Gazzetta @fgaz  
    Mentors: Carter Schonwald, Andreas Klebinger, chessai  
    [Student report](https://github.com/fgaz/gsoc/blob/master/2020/report.md)

2.  **Add primops to expand the (boxed) array API**  
    Student: buggymcbugfix  
    Mentors: andrewthad, Andreas Klebinger, chessai  
    [Student report](https://github.com/buggymcbugfix/not-not-a-blog/blob/master/blog/2020-08-28-gsoc/post.md)

3.  **Build-integration and Badges for Hackage**  
    Student: Shubham Awasthi  
    Mentors: hvr, Gershom Bazerman  
    [Student report](https://awasthishubh.github.io/gsoc-2020-haskell/report.html)

4.  **Building the Haskell Language Server and more**  
    Student: Luke Lau  
    Mentors: Alan Zimmerman, Pepe Iborra, Zubin Duggal  
    [Student report](https://gist.github.com/bubba/22719e8854c728bc726d1a6cfb9ded81)

5.  **Custom Dataloader for Hasktorch**  
    Student: Andre Daprato  
    Mentors: Austin Huang, Adam Paszke, Torsten Scholak, Junji Hashimoto

6.  **Documentation generator for the Dhall configuration language**  
    Student: German Robayo  
    Mentors: Profpatsch, Gabriel Gonzalez, sjakobi  
    [Student report](https://dev.to/german1608/season-finale-dhall-documentation-generator-2lfn)

7.  **Finish the package candidate workflow for Hackage**  
    Student: Sitao Chen  
    Mentors: hvr, Gershom Bazerman  
    [Student report](https://sitaochen.github.io/hackage-server/)

    > This summer, I have participated in Google Summer of Code with Haskell
    > org and worked on Hackage candidate UI and workflow. Without previous
    > experience in open source development, I was able to grasp a large
    > codebase and its structure in a short period with the help of my
    > mentors. Besides, I got a chance to learn about how to make API calls
    > and how to improve UI using Haskell in a formal setting. This
    > experience helps me have a better understanding of packages workflow
    > management and web services in Haskell. I wish I can contribute again
    > in the future!

8.  **Functional Machine Learning Algorithms for Music Generation**  
    Student: Elizabeth Wilson  
    Mentors: Alex McLean, Austin Huang, Torsten Scholak  
    [Student report](https://blog.tidalcycles.org/autonomous-live-coding-summer-of-haskell-project/)

9.  **Multiple Home Packages for GHC**  
    Student: fendor  
    Mentors: Zubin Duggal, John Ericson, Matthew Pickering  
    [Student report](https://gist.github.com/fendor/5b26d36538787c8c2ed8c6eb6e68541f)

    > Haskell IDE Engine was the first open source project I ever contributed
    > to, and over time, it became of a project of passion for me. Over the
    > months I dove deeper into Haskell tooling, until I got the chance to work
    > on GHC itself in this year's Google Summer of Code! I worked on this
    > project to improve the tooling situation for Haskell, as well as improving
    > the IDE experience by implementing features needed by both.
    >
    > The project itself proved to be challenging, mainly because of my
    > unfamiliarity with the GHC code base. However, with the help of my helpful
    > mentors, I was able to overcome the challenges and learned a lot about
    > GHC.  I am glad I had the chance to work on this project, although I did
    > not accomplish everything I wanted to, yet.

10. **Number Field Sieves**  
    Student: Federico Bongiorno  
    Mentors: Sergey Vinokurov, Andrew Lelechenko  
    [Student report](https://github.com/folidota/GSoC2020/blob/master/GSoC2020/NumberFieldSieves.pdf)

11. **Optimising Haskell developer tool performance using OpenTelemetry**  
    Student: Michalis Pardalos  
    Mentors: Dmitry Ivanov, Matthew Pickering  

    > My project was about adding support for opentelemetry tracing into ghcide,
    > the core component of haskell-language-server. I had very little
    > experience with open-source development, or the internals of haskell
    > and ghc before this project and I can say for sure that this has
    > changed. Aside from working on ghcide itself, I also had to submit patches
    > to haskell-opentelemetry, implementing features necessary for this
    > project. When the project was blocked by a ghc bug, I also took this as an
    > opportunity to dive into ghc and fix it myself, which I found incredibly
    > rewarding and consider a valuable experience.
    >
    > Even though I ended up running out of time and not finishing everything
    > I hoped for in the project, I can say for sure that it was a positive
    > experience which I would absolutely recommend.

12. **Update stylish-haskell to use ghc-lib-parser**  
    Student: Beatrice Vergani  
    Mentors: Jasper Van der Jeugt, lukaszgolebiewski, Pawe≈Ç Szulc  
    [Student report](https://www.beatricevergani.com/posts/gsoc2020/)

Google will be hosting GSoC again in 2021, and of course we plan to apply again.
If you have ideas for projects that students could work on, we'll be using the
same format as the years before -- [this page](/ideas.html) has more information
on how to submit an idea.

Thanks a lot to everyone involved!
