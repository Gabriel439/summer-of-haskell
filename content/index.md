# Introduction

The Summer of Haskell is an effort by Haskell.Org to reach out to students and
encourage them to contribute to the Haskell community with the aid of
experienced mentors.  This program is open to college students, 18 or older, in
most countries.

GSoC 2020 is over!  You can read more about our projects in our
[wrap-up blogpost](/news/2020-10-12-final-results.html).

# Google Summer of Code 2021

Google will be hosting GSoC again in 2021, and of course we plan to apply again.
If you have ideas for projects that students could work on, we'll be using the
same format as the years before -- [this page](/ideas.html) has more information
on how to submit an idea.
