title: Restore ihaskell-widgets
---

[IHaskell][ihaskell] is a a kernel that allows you to create interactive
Jupyter notebooks. [ihaskell-widgets] is a library for making the [IHaskell
kernel][ihaskell] work with [ipywidgets].

*ipywidgets* provide GUI controls for individual named variables in a
Jupyter notebook. They are used, for example, to parameterize a rendered
graph, plot, or chart with a GUI slider which instantly updates the
rendering with the new parameter. *ihaskell-widgets* stopped working with
*ipywidgets* version 7 in 2018.

This Github issue has some of the particulars:
